# Week 4, Day 2, May 27 2015

## Lectures

- [Templating with underscore or lodash](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/resources/blob/master/lessons/templates.md)
  - Read the docs on underscore!
  - The key for templates is:
    - `<%- m.name %>` writes the name out with HTML escaped
    - `<%= m.name %>` writes the name out with HTML unescaped
    - `<% expr %>` evaluates the specified JavaScript expression, for example:
      - `<% if (m.isYoung) { %> <h1>You're young!</h1> <% } %>`

- [Routing](https://github.com/tiy-durham-fe-cohort4/resources/blob/master/lessons/routing.md)

- Guest design lecture from Chance

## Exercise

Create a single page application that uses routing to show different content
based on routes. I should be able to type in `#hello/anythinghere` and it will
show a greeting for the `anythinghere` part of the URL:

- #hello/george
  - Shows: '<h1>Hello, George</h1>'
- #hello/sally
  - Shows: '<h1>Hello, Sally</h1>'
- #home
  - Shows some default home screen
