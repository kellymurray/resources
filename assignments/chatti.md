# Chatti

## Description

You've been hired by a company like *Slack*, and they want to add a bot to
their chat application. They've asked you to prototype it.

The way it works is, when a user types in a chat message that begins with an
ampersand '@', the chat program will run a command.

So, if the user types this into the chat application:

    @calc 2 + 2

The bot will reply with:

    2 + 2 = 4

The chat can also look up weather. If the user types in:

    @temp Durham, NC

The bot will reply with:

    It's 75Â° in Durham, NC

There are many commands that the company would like to eventually incorporate:

    @help - replies with the list of all supported commands
    @temp - replies with the temperature of the specified location
    @weather - replies with the forecast for the specified location
    @gh - replies with profile information about the specified github user
    @etsy - replies with the top few listings for an Etsy search
    @es - replies with the spanish translation
    @fr - replies with the french translation
    @giphy - replies with a gif
    @bg - changes the background color
    @whatis - replies with the definition of the specified word/phrase
    @wiki - replies with the wikipedia article matching the query
