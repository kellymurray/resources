## Styleguides

- An HTML page (or pages) which contains all of the markup and styles your app will need
- Other devs/designers can go there, copy HTML snippets, drop em into an app, etc
- Helps you focus on style exclusively without worrying about technical issues

---

## Component libraries

- Similar to styleguides in that you build little UI components in isolation
- That UI component can be dropped into an app as need be
